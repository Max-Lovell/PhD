No matter how much you meditated, all responses are anonymised before being viewed by the experimenters, and you will be in no way penalised for your answer (e.g. you will still be eligible for full course credits, if that is applicable to you). We require accurate data on this for the project to be a successful contribution to my PhD thesis, and a trustworthy addition to the scientific knowledge on the subject, which often goes towards policies and the delivery of therapy.
