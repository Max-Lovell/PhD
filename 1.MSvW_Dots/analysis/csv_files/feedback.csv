"81607","world","I enjoyed most of the course and was glad I did it. It was frustrating sometimes to sit down and get myself ready for the meditation only to find that I needed a prop or to be in a busy place or a noisy place. I never changed location or got up to get a prop because that would have broken the mood - but I think the meditations would have been better if I had made the effort to do that. It would have been much better if there was a bit at the end of the previous session to say e.g. 'during the next session you will be asked to listen to the sounds around you so you might wish to complete the session somewhere that is not completely silent.' I found the repetition of the instruction to 'note it without judging it' (or something like that) particularly helpful. I would have found a few more comments aimed at teaching me how to do it right helpful.","1,3","I didn't know much about mindfulness so difficult to say but it made sense given my understanding of mindfulness","1",""

It could potentially be worth maybe controlling for PMS with women, at least personally I feel my concentration can be worse during these times so it could have an impact on results I am not sure.
In the questions at the end it could also be worth asking if anything significant happened in-between the start and end of the course outside of regular ups and downs of life that could impact concentration/ effect of the meditations, for example I have exams coming up and had a personal situation come up a few days ago that of course this was helpful for but I guess it could make things harder as well if that makes any sense?
