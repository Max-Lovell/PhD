No matter how much you meditated, all responses are anonymised before being viewed by the experimenters, and you will be in no way penalised for your answer (e.g. you will still be eligible for full course credits, if that is applicable to you). We require accurate data on this for the project to be a successful contribution to my PhD thesis, and a trustworthy addition to the scientific knowledge on the subject, which often goes towards policies and the delivery of therapy.

It was frustrating sometimes to sit down and get myself ready for the meditation only to find that I needed a prop or to be in a busy place or a noisy place. I never changed location or got up to get a prop because that would have broken the mood - but I think the meditations would have been better if I had made the effort to do that. It would have been much better if there was a bit at the end of the previous session to say e.g. 'during the next session you will be asked to listen to the sounds around you so you might wish to complete the session somewhere that is not completely silent.' I found the repetition of the instruction to 'note it without judging it' (or something like that) particularly helpful. I would have found a few more comments aimed at teaching me how to do it right helpful.","Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/100.0.4896.127 Safari/537.36","34277"
