We are looking for male and female participants to take part in our study. Please take your time to consider if you would like to take part. To take part you should not have not tried meditation before in a formal way for more than ten hours, nor taken part in any mindfulness training studies. You will be given the opportunity to engage in a two-week meditation course for free.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The study consists of two sessions of about 1 hour each&nbsp;in which you first complete questionnaires about the way you attend to everyday activities, and then are taken through a number of hypnotic suggestions via a skype call with a researcher. In addition, you will take part in a two week online meditation course. You will be asked to engage in a 10-minute meditation each day. That may not sound like much, but it is a commitment to do this every day.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>During this study, you may become more aware of difficult thoughts and feelings. If you feel unsettled and do not want to take part in the study anymore, then you can withdraw from the study at any time without any explanation.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Please note that we cannot disclose our specific hypotheses at this time, but they will be described in the debriefing information at the end of the study.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-weight: 900; word-spacing: 0.05em;\">Will my data be secure?&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>You will be asked to provide your email and date of birth to allow us to match your data across time points, and monitor your meditation progress.

The data we collect might be presented at conferences or written up for publication in academic journals. You will never be able to be identified from these outputs, the data from everyone in the experiment will be pooled and trends reported. No-one outside the research team will be able to identify you as a participant.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-weight: 900; word-spacing: 0.05em;\">Do I have to take part?&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>No, you do not have to take part, and if you start the study you can withdraw at any time, without giving a reason and we will not use your data.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>If you would like your data to be removed at any time, please email ec351@sussex.ac.uk.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once you have completed the study your data will be submitted and you will not be able to withdraw it (at this time we will delete your name and contact details and we will no longer be able to identify you).<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family: inherit; margin: 0px 0.1em 0px 0px; vertical-align: baseline; font-weight: 900; padding: 0px; border: 0px; word-spacing: 0.05em; text-rendering: optimizelegibility;\">What if I become emotionally distressed during the study?<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>In a very small proportion of people the focus and introspective nature of meditation practice may invoke emotional discomfort.

The idea is this: when you notice something in the outside world, for example, the sky, you might think of something in the outside world: \u201cthe sky is blue\u201d. However, at other times you might become aware of yourself seeing that the sky is blue, and you might think \u201c<em>I see&nbsp;that&nbsp;<\/em>the sky is blue\u201d.

We saw that there seem to be two forms of mindfulness in use, mindfulness of the world around us, and mindfulness of our mental states (like thoughts, emotions, etc). We feel that mindfulness of understanding one\u2019s own mental states, as it was originally described in the ancient Buddhist texts, should be more effective as a therapy than mindfulness of the world around us. However, we see mindfulness of the world as a minimal mindfulness condition which will have certain uses, for example for beginners and those for whom certain mental states are overly problematic, such as in the midst of an anxiety attack.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThis study has three groups: a mindfulness of mental states \u2018experimental\u2019 condition, a mindfulness of the world 'control' condition, and a waitlist control. The 'mental states' group focused on things in their mind, whilst the 'world' group focused on the world around them. Those of you in the waitlist control were really in the most crucial condition to understand if either of the other groups actually received any benefit from their courses. Thank you for your patience and for completing all the tests, we really do appreciate you taking the time to do this!<br \/>\n<br \/>\nAll participants can find a copy of all of the course materials from both the mindfulness of mental states and world conditions at the following link: https:\/\/universityofsussex.eu.qualtrics.com\/jfe\/form\/SV_1Y1cpZndfWrXoEu<br \/>\n<br \/>\nWe hope you gained something personally from the meditation practice. We would like to&nbsp;thank you again for your participation, which has been invaluable for us.
