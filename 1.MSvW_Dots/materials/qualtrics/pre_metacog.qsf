Thank you for carefully reading this information sheet, a copy of which you can keep for your records. This study is being conducted by student researcher Max Lovell and project supervisor Professor Zoltan Dienes from the School of Psychology, University of Sussex, who are happy to be contacted (m.lovell@sussex.ac.uk or z.dienes@sussex.ac.uk) if you have any questions. To take part in this study you must be 18 or older, and have not taken a formal course in meditation before (that is, not obtained guidance on how to meditate and used it to meditate for more than 10 hours) or participated in other meditation studies.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Why have I been invited for testing and what will I do?<\/strong><br>\nWe are testing 150-300 people who are adults with less than 10 hours meditation practice. To take part you should not have not tried meditation before in a formal way for more than ten hours, nor taken part in any mindfulness training studies. The intervention will have 10 meditation sessions, one each day, and each is 10 minutes long. After each session, you will be asked to answer a couple of questions, after which we will send you the next mediation session the following morning via email. At the beginning and end of the course there is a 30-40 minute questionnaire for you to complete about mental health and awareness, which includes a simple interactive cognitive task (Note: you will need a laptop\/tablet to take part in this cognitive task - but each day's mediation is available on smartphone). That may not sound like much, but it is a commitment to do the practice every day.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Are there any risks or benefits to taking part?<\/strong><br>\nDuring this study, you may become more aware of difficult thoughts and feelings. If you feel unsettled and do not want to take part in the study anymore, then you can withdraw from the study at any time without any explanation. Please note that we cannot disclose our specific hypotheses at this time, but they will be described in the debriefing information at the end of the study. If you experience any emotional distress and feel unable to cope, please contact local mental health support services, or consult your doctor or GP for further guidance and support. If you are in Sussex, UK, The Sussex Mental Health line is available Monday to Friday 5pm-9am, and 24 hours at weekends and Bank holidays (tel: 0300 5000 101).

The results of this research may be written into a scientific report for a PhD thesis publication. The data we collect might be presented at conferences or written up for publication in academic journals. You will be asked to provide your email and date of birth to allow us to match your data across time points, and monitor your meditation progress. However, your data will be kept confidential to your researcher, and at the point of analysis, any personal information that could be used to identify you will be destroyed to ensure anonymity. On request, your data will be deleted at any point up to anonymisation. You will never be able to be identified from these outputs, the data from everyone in the experiment will be pooled and trends reported.
